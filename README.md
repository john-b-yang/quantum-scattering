## Fellas
Look at the README.md file in the doc folder for what I was thinking
on Sunday about your individual pieces. Please message me with 
questions if you have any and especially if you think of 
something creative and clever. The main goal is to reproduce 
the cross-section curves in the pdf but Phil made the point that 
if we continue to show hard work, then we don't need to worry about 
the grade. SO have fun and be creative!
